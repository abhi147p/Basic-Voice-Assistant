# Basic-Voice-Assistant
We have used some of built-in functions to build basic voice-assistant, such as 
1. pyttsx3: python text to speech
2. speech recognition, os, wikipedia etc

Also it recommends some of the movies and books based on the dataset that, we have provided and the past movie or book data.
